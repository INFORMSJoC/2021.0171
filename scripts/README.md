# Scripts

This directory contains the test files for the computation of the metrics in the example of section 3 of the research article. The inputs are in the directory test_data, which contains Tables 1-4 from the paper. Tables 1-3 are the inputs (R,D,M); Table 4 is the table of the matching decisions made. The script section3_test.py computes the metrics obtained. To run the script:
1. install ppe_match
2. change the directory in the code with the local directory that contains the test data (Table1.csv, Table2.csv, Table3.csv, Table4.csv)
3. the file "section3_metrics_computation.xlsx" contains the details on how the metrics are computed
